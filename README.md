# Weather-Monitoring-System-and-Prediction-and-Analysis-for-Local-Region-Using-Python-AI-ML
About the project:-
• Designed an Arduino Based Weather Monitoring Hardware System that for a particular localized region shows real-time data such
as temperature, pressure, and humidity.
• Researched and Created a Machine Learning Model based on Forest Regression Model over two CSV file datasets.
• Output of the model successfully predicted the weather in the local region

Details:-
forestm.py python file is which when executed gives out the forest regressor model which is used in main.
gradient.py python file uses gradient boosting regressor models to predict the output.
weather2.csv is the data set on which the machine learning model is trained.
gradientm.py python file is which when executed gives the required gradient boosting regressor model.
