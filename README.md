# Weather-Monitoring-System-and-Prediction-and-Analysis-for-Local-Region-Using-Python-AI-ML
• Designed an Arduino Based Weather Monitoring Hardware System that for a particular localized region shows real-time data such
as temperature, pressure, and humidity.
• Researched and Created a Machine Learning Model based on Forest Regression Model over two CSV file datasets.
• Output of the model successfully predicted the weather in the local region
